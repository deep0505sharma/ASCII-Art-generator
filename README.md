# ASCII-Art-generator
ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a common encoding format used for representing strings and text data in computers.

But..what if we use this for something other than text?

How about images? Images on your terminal!

The editor for ASCII-graphics, combining a graphical editor and an image to text converter. Decorate your text and surprise your readers with an original social media post or blog post using ASCII graphics. The tool does not require an internet connection and can work offline in a browser.
OpenCv, PIL,NumPy are some of the libraries I have used to write my code.
Prerequisites:
Basics of Image Processing and efficient in Python language
